### A. Core Tasks
- [x] Create a website using HTML and Bootstrap (use the starter template and include the responsive meta-tag to make your site responsive on mobile devices). (2 pts)
- [x] Add a list of tasks and use CSS to format the list so that it is a well-designed to do list. Be thoughtful and intentional about your design. (2 pts)
- [x] Allow the user to add items to the to do list. (This will require additional HTML elements as well as JavaScript.) (2 pts)
- [x] Allow the user to check items off their list after the tasks have been completed. (2 pts)
- [x] Allow the user to delete tasks from the list. (Note that this is not the same as completing tasks; the user may decide that it was an error to have included the tasks in the first place.) (2 pts)
### B. Make it Better
- [x] Allow users to associate a due date with a task and display the due dates next to the tasks. (Use <input type="date"> for the date input.) (2 pts)
- [x] Allow users to uncheck items that were accidentally checked. (1 pts)
### C. Even Better
- [x] Allow users to color code tasks to indicate priority or type of task. (2 pts)
- [x] Give some sort of celebratory recognition when users complete a task â€“ visual or sound or both. (See Google Tasks for an example.) Again, be thoughtful and deliberate about your design. (1 pt)
### D. Cherry on Top:
- [x] Allow users to define subtasks. Subtasks should be able to be checked off/deleted individually OR checked off /deleted together with the super-task. (1 pt)
